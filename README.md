InciWeb Incident Updates App
============================

The **InciWeb Incident Updates** app displays wildfire incident updates
from [InciWeb](https://inciweb.nwcg.gov/), the incident information
system operated by the National Wildfire Coordinating Group (NWCG).
InciWeb collects reports on wildfires from regional agencies around the
United States and displays this information on their website. They also
provide an RSS feed with updates on current incidents, including
incident names, geographic coordinates, links to InciWeb, and written
status information. This app reads the InciWeb RSS feed and presents the
information in a convenient mobile interface.


InciWeb RSS
-----------

The web service used by this app is the [InciWeb National Incidents RSS
feed](https://inciweb.nwcg.gov/feeds/rss/incidents/), which has an entry for each incident currently tracked by InciWeb.

Each incident contains:

- a name
- date and time of update
- description
- link to InciWeb page for incident
- latitude and longitude

The terms of use for InciWeb RSS feeds, as stated on their
[FAQ for the service](https://inciweb.nwcg.gov/feeds/rss/), is that
"*InciWeb RSS feeds are provided free of charge for commercial,
non-commercial use by individuals or organizations.*"
